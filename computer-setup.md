***Students will need their laptops set up with Microsoft Excel by the start of
classes, Unix Shell - Bash by week 2, R by week 3, and Jupyter Notebook by week 5.***

### Microsoft Excel

You likely already have this installed or please visit the IT Connect page on [UW Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus](https://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/uware/microsoft/microsoft-office-365-proplus/)

### Unix Shell - Bash      

from [Software Carpentry Lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/shell-novice/blob/gh-pages/setup.md)    
> The `shell` is a program that enables us to send commands to the computer and receive output. It is also referred to as the `terminal` or `command line`.
>
> Some computers include a default Unix Shell program.
> The steps below describe some methods for identifying and opening a Unix Shell program if you already have one installed.
> There are also options for identifying and downloading a Unix Shell program, a Linux/UNIX emulator, or a program to access a UNIX server.
>
> If none of the options below address your circumstances, try an online search for: UNIX shell [your computer model] [your operating system].
>
> ### Linux
> The default shell for Linux operating systems is usually Bash.
> On most versions of Linux, it is accessible by running the Terminal program,
>  which can be found via the applications menu or the search bar.  
> If your machine is set up to use something other than bash, you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `bash`.
>
> ### Mac OS
> For a Mac computer, the default Unix Shell is Bash,
> and it is available via the Terminal Utilities program within your Applications folder.
>
> To open Terminal, try one or both of the following:
> * Go to your Applications. Within Applications, open the Utilities folder. Locate Terminal in the Utilities folder and open it.
> * Use the Mac ‘Spotlight’ computer search function. Search for: Terminal and press [Enter] - this will open Terminal.
>

> [How to Use Terminal on a Mac](http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/)
>
> ### Windows
> Computers with Windows operating systems do not automatically have a Unix Shell program installed.
> In this course, we encourage you to use an emulator included in [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/),
> which gives you access to both Bash shell commands and Git.
>
> Once installed, you can open a terminal by running the program Git Bash from the Windows start menu.

### R

Download and install the [R base system](http://cran.rstudio.com/). I recommend you use the [R studio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to work with the base system.
