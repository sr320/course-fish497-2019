### Key Points

The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.

Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).

Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.

`cd path` changes the current working directory.

`ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.

`pwd` prints the user’s current working directory.



---

### More Key Points

`whoami` shows the user’s current identity.

`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.

A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.

An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.

Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows.

`..` means ‘the directory above the current one’; `.` on its own means ‘the current directory’.

Most files’ names are `something.extension`. The extension isn’t required, and doesn’t guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
