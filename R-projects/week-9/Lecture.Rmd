## Required Packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```



## Data

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172")
head(data)
```


```{r, cache=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172")
head(data)
```




The data includes `r length(unique(data$species_id))` species.



## Analysis

Get the time-series of counts for all species.
          
```{r}
time_series <-
  data %>%
  group_by(species_id, year) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  filter(species_id %in% c('DM', 'DO', 'DS')) %>%
  na.omit()

knitr::kable(head(time_series))
```



## Plot the time-series.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(time_series, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~species_id)
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
